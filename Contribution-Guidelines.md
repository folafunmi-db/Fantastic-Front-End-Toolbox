# Contribution Guidelines

* Inspired partially by the guidelines from [Awesome-Design-Tools](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Contribution_Guidelines.md)

If you would like to contribute, just send a Pull Request. Please:
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one to prevent duplicates. 
* Try to make your Pull Request descriptive.
* New categories are welcomed, if you have 2+ tools to submit to that category.
* Check spelling and grammar.

## One tool can go only to one category
Every category presents some design work or task. Many tools allow us to solve multiple tasks. But in this list, one tool with full description & link is submitted only to one category (section). Why do so? Because we want to avoid any duplications and misunderstandings around tool functionality.

## Link Format
* Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests: ``[Tool](link) â€” description``. The description should start from the lower-case letter unless it's starting with the tool name.
  
## Review Workflow  
We will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. Your contribution might be rejected if the tool didn't pass our curation. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think we are being unfair, do let us know.
